# OS-Level Vulnerabilities in Virtualized Environments

## Overview

Virtualization has become an integral part of modern computing, enabling better scalability, flexibility, and resource optimization. However, this advancement introduces critical OS-level security challenges that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of virtualized environments.

This research paper, **"OS-Level Vulnerabilities in Virtualized Environments: Examination, Mitigation, and Future Directions,"** provides an in-depth analysis of various attack vectors in virtualized systems, including:

- **Isolation Failures** (e.g., VM Escape)
- **Hypervisor Exploits** (e.g., Hyper-V RCE, ESXi Heap Overflow)
- **Side-Channel Attacks** (e.g., Spectre, Meltdown, Rowhammer)
- **Container Security Issues**

The paper evaluates existing security measures such as sandboxing, least privilege policies, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security patching while proposing innovative approaches like AI-driven threat detection, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and blockchain auditing.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Virtualization Security Risks**
- **Hypervisor Security & Exploits**
- **Container Security Threats**
- **Side-Channel Attacks and Mitigations**
