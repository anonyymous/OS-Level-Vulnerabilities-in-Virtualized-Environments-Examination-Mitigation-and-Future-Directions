# OS-Level-Vulnerabilities-in-Virtualized-Environments-Examination-Mitigation-and-Future-Directions
This paper explores OS-level vulnerabilities in virtualized environments, including isolation failures, hypervisor exploits, and side-channel attacks. It evaluates mitigation techniques and proposes future solutions such as AI-driven threat detection, hardware-assisted security, and blockchain auditing to enhance virtualization security.
